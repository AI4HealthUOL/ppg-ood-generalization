## **ðŸ“Œ Overview**
This repository contains scripts for training and evaluating AI models on **PulseDB subsets**, while analyzing their generalization to both **PulseDB and external datasets**. The key objectives of this project include:

1. **Preprocessing and converting PulseDB datasets** into machine-readable formats.
2. **OOD (Out-of-Distribution) generalization analysis** by comparing model performance on **ID (in-distribution) vs. OOD datasets**.
3. **Statistical similarity measurement** between PulseDB subsets and external datasets.
4. **Weight-based domain adaptation techniques** to improve model robustness.

## **ðŸ›  Step-by-Step Procedure**

### **1. Preprocessing the PulseDB Dataset**
This project utilizes the **PulseDB dataset** (Wang et al., 2023) for **training and ID/OOD evaluations**. We define different subsets based on the data source (**Vital, MIMIC, or Combined**) with different training scenarios such as **Calib, CalibFree, and AAMI-based subsets**.

ðŸ“Œ **To generate the dataset**, follow the instructions in the **PulseDB_Preprocessing** section of this repository:

### **2. Preprocessing the External (BP-Benchmarking) Dataset**
This project also utilizes the **External dataset** (GonzÃ¡lez et al., 2023) for **OOD evaluation**. To evaluate the generalization performance of AI models beyond PulseDB, we utilize an external dataset that provides an independent benchmark for non-invasive blood pressure estimation. This dataset allows us to test model robustness in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios and assess the impact of dataset shifts.

ðŸ“Œ **To prepare the dataset for testing**, follow the instructions in the **External_dataset_Preprocessing** section of this repository:

 Summary of the datasets utilized in this study: Two subsets PulseDB (Wang et al. 2023) for training and four external datasets (GonzÃ¡lez et al., 2023) for OOD evaluation.

### **3. Training Models with PulseDB Subsets**
Once preprocessing is complete, you can train different models using various **PulseDB datasets**., leveraging different training scenarios to optimize model performance. These scenarios include variations in calibration strategies and dataset splits to assess their impact on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.

### **4. Applying Weights in Training for Domain Adaptation**
To analyze the effect of **using weights in the training procedure**, compute the **weights for each training set**, adjusting them based on dataset similarities and distributional shifts to improve model robustness and adaptation across different domains.

ðŸ“Œ **Use the code and instructions provided in the weighting section:**
