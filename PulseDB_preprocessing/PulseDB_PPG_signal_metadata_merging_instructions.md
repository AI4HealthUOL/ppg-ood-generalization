# DataFrame and Signal Files Merger

This script merges multiple DataFrames from CSV files and signal files from numpy (.npy) files into a single consolidated DataFrame and signal file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Setup

1. Ensure you have the following files in a single directory:
   - `df_train.csv`
   - `df_test_1.csv`
   - `df_test_2.csv`
   - `df_test_3.csv`
   - `df_test_4.csv`
   - `signals_f_ppg_train.npy`
   - `signals_f_ppg_test_1.npy`
   - `signals_f_ppg_test_2.npy`
   - `signals_f_ppg_test_3.npy`
   - `signals_f_ppg_test_4.npy`

2. Replace `./path/to/files/` in the script with the actual path to the directory containing your files.
